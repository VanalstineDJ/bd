/*
Anywhere on the page that a <button class="foo">...</button> element appears, clicking it, or any HTML tag inside of it, will run the doSomething function.

Since Event Delegation is used, only a single click handler is registered on the document object. If more <button>s are created as a result of an AJAX call, you don't have to register click handlers on those new <button>s since we take advantage of the click event bubbling up from the element the user clicked on to the document object itself.
